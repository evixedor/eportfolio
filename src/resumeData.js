	aboutme:
	 " I was a production associate at Spartan Peripheral Devices, a leading manufacturer of valves and control solutions for the markets of commercial, industrial and large-scale residential plumbing. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Laurentian University and a passion for computer programming and web development. I have acquired multiple certifications in Python, React, and Node.js from online courses and platforms. In my previous roles, I worked with a team of production associates and supervisors to design, test, and optimize the production processes and systems for various products and projects. I used my skills in Node.js, Python, and React to create and maintain web applications and interfaces to train myself to support development operations and data analysis. I also contributed to the quality assurance and troubleshooting of software and hardware components. I enjoy learning new technologies and tools that can enhance the efficiency and performance of any team. I am motivated by the opportunity to apply my mechanical engineering and computer programming skills to create innovative and sustainable solutions for the engineering design and technology industry. I value collaboration, creativity, and continuous improvement, and I seek to bring diverse perspectives and experiences to any team.",
